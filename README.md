Douft – A Curious AI Companion That Learns From You
Douft is a web-based AI companion that begins life knowing absolutely nothing.
It doesn’t know what it is, where it is, or how the world works — until you teach it.
As Douft learns, it grows, unlocks new abilities, and slowly becomes a smarter, more capable digital companion.

Douft isn’t a chatbot.
It’s a teach-first AI pet with progression, memory, and a narrative arc.

🌱 Core Concept
Douft starts as a blank-slate entity with no built-in knowledge.
Every fact, idea, or explanation comes directly from the user.
As Douft absorbs information, it increases its knowledge level, which unlocks new features:

Level 10: Wikipedia search

Level 40: DuckDuckGo search

Level 100: Rebirth cycle (new egg with inherited traits)

This progression system makes Douft feel alive — a creature that grows because of you.

🧠 Key Features
Teach-first logic  
Douft never assumes or invents facts. When it doesn’t know something, it asks you to explain it.

Persistent memory  
Everything you teach Douft is stored and searchable using SQLite + FTS5.

Autonomous learning (optional)  
Once unlocked, Douft can research past questions on its own and report back.

Cinematic UX moments  
Growth scenes, spotlight interactions, hatch events, and unlock animations make the experience feel like a game.

Evolution system  
Douft grows through stages, eventually producing a new egg with inherited traits.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Flask or Node.js  (project-agnostic)

Database: SQLite with FTS5 full‑text search

Hosting: Render

📦 Project Goals
Create an AI companion that feels personal and alive

Build a memory-driven system that evolves over time

Keep all learning user-controlled and permission-based

Deliver a smooth, game-like experience in a simple web app

🚧 Status
The project is actively in development as the Android version is being adapted into a full web application.
Core logic, memory systems, and progression rules are already defined — the web UI and backend integration are now underway.
